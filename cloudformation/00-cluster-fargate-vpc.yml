Description: AWS Fargate cluster running containers in a public subnet. Only supports
             public facing load balancer, and public service discovery namespaces.
Parameters:
  EnvironmentName:
    Type: String
    Default: production
    Description: "A friendly environment name that will be used for namespacing all cluster resources. Example: staging, qa, or production"
Mappings:
  # Hard values for the subnet masks. These masks define
  # the range of internal IP addresses that can be assigned.
  # The VPC can have all IP's from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255
  # There are two subnets which cover the ranges:
  #
  # 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.255
  # 10.0.1.0 - 10.0.1.255
  #
  # If you need more IP addresses (perhaps you have so many
  # instances that you run out) then you can customize these
  # ranges to add more
